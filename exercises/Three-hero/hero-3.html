<h1>Who we are and our history</h1>
<p>Siracusa, formally known as the Confederate City-States of Siracusa or the
Siracusan Confederation for short, is a Terran country bordering Kazdel,
Laterano, and Leithanien. Home of many Lupos and Vulpos, Siracusa is a
confederation of twenty-two autonomous city-states under the effective control
of twelve mafia families, the Dodici Famiglie, with a unified leadership of a
powerful Capo dei capi.</p>
<p>The Siracusan mafia could be traced back to the classical era when Siracusa
was a confederation of manors until its annexation by Leithanien as its tenth
autonomous Kreis. The modern nation-state of Siracusa was founded following its
independence from Leithanien, but the nation quickly fell into decades of
anarchy marked with open conflicts among the famiglie until the current Capo of
the mafia, Signora Sicilia, unified them under a common law that regulates
their activities and limits their political power.</p>
<p>Despite its lawlessness, Siracusa possesses a rich culture, a lot of which
comes from foreign influences. The Siracusan cuisine is praised for its
uniqueness and delicacy; the Church of Laterano has a strong influence on the
Siracusan faith; its legal system is based on Columbian judiciary introduced by
the Columbian famiglie; due to its Leithanian roots, opera is beloved among the
Siracusans from common folks to the nobility.</p>
